This article discusses the new HTTP Client Interface introduced in Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6, which simplifies remote HTTP calls by leveraging Java interfaces. It outlines the development of a reactive Spring Boot RESTful web service designed to retrieve and create photo data from the JSON Placeholder API.

Initially, the service is built without the HTTP client interface, resulting in a more verbose implementation that requires significant boilerplate code. The article then details how to refactor this service using the HTTP Client Interface, which reduces code redundancy and improves readability and maintainability.

Key sections include the definition of a Photo data model, the implementation of a service class using WebClient for API calls, and the creation of an interface (PhotoClient) that defines HTTP exchange methods. A proxy is established to facilitate these requests, significantly simplifying the code in the service layer.

The benefits of the HTTP Client Interface are highlighted, including a cleaner syntax, support for common HTTP methods through annotations, centralized API management, and automatic handling of request and response serialization. Overall, using the HTTP Client Interface greatly enhances the development experience and efficiency when making HTTP requests.
